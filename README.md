 
# Here is a brief explanation of the script:

    The check_zip_folder() function takes a URL as input and uses the requests library to send a HEAD request to the URL. If the response status code is 200, it checks the content-type header to see if it is application/zip, which indicates a ZIP folder. If it is, it prints a message saying that the URL is a valid ZIP folder. If not, it prints a message saying that it is not a ZIP folder. If the response status code is not 200, it prints a message saying that the URL is not available.

  
  
  
  
  
  ## The check_folder_files() function takes a folder path and a file names path as inputs. 
  
  
  
  It reads the file names from the file names path and checks if each file exists in the folder path. 
  
  
  If a file exists, it prints a message saying that the file exists in the folder. If not, it prints a message saying that the file does not exist in the folder.

    The example usage shows how to call the functions with example inputs. You can replace the zip_url, folder_path, and file_names_path variables with your own inputs.

Note that this script assumes that the requests library is installed. You can install it using pip install requests.
